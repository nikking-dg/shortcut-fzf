# Shortcut FZF

This project is not designed to be easily used by others.

It's a hacked together POC to see if it's useful to me.

## Dependencies

- Everything included in `shell.nix`
- Gpaste as a clipboard manager
- Alacritty for terminal popup

# Setup


Set up `aichat`. Set up roles that match the roles names in `roles.txt` save for `original`.

Add a `.envrc` and keyboard shortcut to `shortcut-popup.sh`.
